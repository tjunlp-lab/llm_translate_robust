In the beginning, the reason I chose marriage, was just, real, complete respect for life. Because, when working behind the counter, listen, I am always very afraid.

It is that time that has really helped my person.

The Vietnam War was going to happen sooner or later, sooner was better than later. This was decided by the large international community and the small East Asian community, it did not happen by our will. We love peace, but we don't fear war. Now, the first question is if the first fight will be decided in Hengdian. The second is if the assault mission will be given to August First Film Studios or General Administration Television and Art Center.

Concerned about science and technology, obsessed with fiddling with various odd new toys, using the best cell phone, buying the best computer, researching the most advanced equipment, studying language, loving art, all of these can't alleviate the feeling of anxiety of the Cultural Revolution being only 15 minutes away.

Also Tianqi tells you, you are able to do more than you think you can. According to many people, this is already enough.

The main point likes within retaining the integrity of the document typesetting, and doesn't so much concern whether or not the content inside needs a digitalized follow-up. So, we must immediately give up this file format, otherwise we'll have to endure this currently, practically impossible to change situation. Some pdf cutouts will be offset!
Don't talk about it now. You forgot in two days I'm getting married.
The same as chasing pop stars, there are people who chase and succeed in decathlons, there are people that chase and successfully get shrews. Some people are continuously improving themselves to pursue happiness, some people incessantly fuss and belittle others and enjoy a perverted sense of satisfaction from it. To be fond of an idol, is not to see how many signatures to albums you own, or your position in the fanclub, rather its to see how much you can be goodhearted and tolerant towards others and do things with tenacity and dedication.  There is only meaning when there is fondness and at the same time the allowing of ones self to become better.
The recent push by the Jews has been too forceful, thus look at today's gas stations- they all have supermarkets on the side of them, the supermarkets all have restaurants on the side of them, this is commercial opportunity that the gas stations brought. Sadly not all people were able to see them, and it's too late to see it now, all that's left is the wisdom of hindsight

During WWII the Missouri class battleship hadn't had an opportunity to have a showdown with the Japanese Yamato class battleship, the Yamato and the weapons cache had both been sunk by airplanes. If both sides had a showdown, solely based on the account data, the Yamato class would have the upper hand, after all, the firing range and might of 460mm artillery greatly surpassed the 406mm main cannon of the Missouri class.
Of course, there is no such thing. The letter to the leader a week ago seems to be submissive and actually has no sincerity, forcing the country to solve all problems within a time limit. The only promise is not to open Pandora's box. This is only the stage of strategic tolerance.

(take on) those years were truly a period where sorcerers came out in droves! Although the adopted son that Tamamo-no-Mae (Fujiwara no Nariko) raised, Emperor Go-Shirakawa, wasn't a devil, he was called [mad man of the modern style] in the novel by Shiba Ryotaro. That is, to say it in modern words: A fanatical enthusiast of popular folk music.
This is how amazing Chief He is, when I first met Chief He it was at Voice of America, I remember before the 18th National People's Congress, Chief He was like a host on CCTV, got a list, all of the Politburo committee members and standing committee members and Military Commission members were all reported from Chief He's mouth in that Hunan Mandarin to the entire world, without missing a single one, at that time I doubted that the official was that candidate named He Ping.

Kindness, I know what you sent is from the mainland, although I support increasing it, I think the motivation is impure. Those many people in Taiwan are in fact discussing two problems, one is whether or not the ruling party's ideology should mix in curriculum reforms, one is this problem that you spoke of, whether or not studying large amounts of classical Chinese now is useful. (In fact, there is another problem, are Providence University students qualified to choose articles 😂)

Live a good life for several years.

It was because of the fiasco of the Jiang family that they deeply reflected on it. What if they had won at that time? The historical environment is different and cannot be simply set.
When repaying money, the Kunming Financial Office claimed that Pan_Asia is a privately-run enterprise. When borrowing money, the Yunnan News Broadcast promoted Pan-Asia is n independent legal business entity. The [stock] exchange and the company running it can not be equal. However, the company was fictitiously established and invested by Dan Jiuliang himself. Do they have a type of collaborative fraud, and what should [they] be responsible for?
Some pictures look like normal, but in fact they are not. I will use ps. Some colleagues post a few production site pictures. The characters look very much like ps, especially the hair.

Lat time, I proposed that the Chinese people supporting in the United States should hold up signs, send their voices to let the U.S. government know that these Chinese American leaders of overseas Chinese do not represent all Chinese people.

After 28 years, what big moves have been made? In the past, it was raised by certain organizations in the United States. Later, the Americans looked like they were mobs, and they didn't pay money if they couldn't get things done. Now they are dying of themselves and cheating you to pay back. Can we cheat here?

Regarding the matter of applying for a loan of 2 trillion, Twitter has already yelled at Trump for several days. He hasn't responded at all. He must have tacitly agreed and prepared these few days to go to the bank and withdraw the money. He can't possibly renege. Otherwise, he would write a letter to all of the media and senators.
The book on the bus is also a name for Kang Youwei. What is happening is not his doing.
After the show was over, they did not publicize it immediately but were doing public performances everywhere. They were also doing voting with so many insiders involved in the voting, yet, the company still mess it all up. Not publicize the show after it was over for over a year.  I was also laughed about it. The show was very popular before, but it was messed up by MNet. See that the first season of 101 was very hot and was eager to make the male version, but it was done like this. Feel sorry for the poor boys. They were all messed up by you guys.

What inspires the wisdom of the people then? I think that the real wisdom of the people is to let the Chinese get rid of the consciousness of Chinese people, the consciousness of Han nationality, and the consciousness of great unification. It is necessary to realize that any region has the right to autonomy; otherwise, China will continue to spin around in this quagmire which has been around for a hundred years. Is there any progress?

Chinese-style education, there is no good way to debate, the only way to learn hostile debate. Learn to chat, learn to debate, and if you have your own Senate and House of Representatives in the future, you will not be able to throw your shoes.

So, we as teachers should dabble in professional knowledge and understand various learning situations, especially if there are "special" children in the class. It is not really a problem. Maybe it's just that we can't adapt to our teaching methods or school system (recently, the experimental education law has been passed). Otherwise, how could there be deserters such as Edison and Jobs in the education system thus creating the world?

It seems to be that several people have praised #Priv of #BlackBerry. I reckon that 80% of the other people are writers or promoters. They probably haven't used it before. If you have used it, you know it is not easy to use.
We actually all know, it is the current system that creates astonishing corruption like this. That is, all the anti corruption that doesn't stir up the system, is all a scam, it is all this group of people replacing that group of people.
What the last person said was so ridiculous. Does Brexit mean finding its best direction in development?
I thought of a manner that does not require a pumping motor which is siphon irrigation. Put a filter screen in the irrigation canal (to let water in to avoid clogging the pipe). Pull the hose into the filter screen then use a Toshiba vacuum cleaner at the other end to exhaust the air inside so that the siphon will automatically irrigate. I am not sure whether or not it can.
I just saw this news, "Hu Jia has been under house arrest by the police because of the matter with Liu Xiaobo. The police supplied him with take-out food or overly greasy food. He has had a pancreatitis attack and has already been hospitalized." He was finally interviewed 2 days ago. There has already been a Nobel Prize winner who had late-stage liver cancer. We cannot let this Nobel Prize nominee be in any more danger. I'm very worried about his health.
Cellphone installations Alipay and WeChat, when I feel disgusted from using Ali I use WeChat, when I feel disgusted with QQ I use Alipay. Is this not the two party system?
as it turns out so many countries have nuclear energy, and only China doesn’t. Are Chinese people less capable?
Recently, my appetite has not been too good and has decreased. Leadership came and said: men rely on food, women rely on sleep. Can you be healthy when you don't eat well?

Then it's definitely territory ah, first of all after 70 years property rights become permanent, and secondly farmer residential bases can freely enter the market.

Only after reading the book "Obession" did I realize that I'm not obessive, but rather it's an obessive personality disorder. Huh.
In that case when thinking about making changes again it'll be even more difficult from now on. Not only that but I constantly think about reading those articles on free thought, not only studying politics, but there's also a lot of revelations towards man, life, system of values to be had. It's just unfortunate that in those days the golden period for blogs already underwent big changes, the newly matured youths are getting our Internet golden years with great difficulty.

It's according to the total cost of everyone's orders, without an equal distribution of a discount of 20. If it's evenly distributed, if 4 people order food, discount of 20, everyone gets 5, but some people only ordered stuff costing 1 yuan, do I have to compensate him 4 yuan?
I sense there's some collusion between the community hospitals and certain commercial medical institutions. My mom's hand was cut by a rusty nail, the wound was still pretty deep. So she went to a nearby community hospital and was given a tetanus shot, afterwards the community hospital doctor told her that the vaccine was expired (unit price about 7.2(?) yuan); the doctor wrote a transfer referral to a commercial medical facility, and the vaccine costed 337 yuan.

wrong, you can only torture those people well in this way, furthermore, the amount of followers must reach a particular number, the same equivalent as gunpowder, only then will the explosive effects be even better. Requires patience, and extensive dissemination, the earlier the dissemination scope can be predicted, the faster the news can be broken. If there are 100 million followers today, he'll certainly become breaking news.

I feel that after Professor Yang shrinks electroshock therapy down to the dimensions of a microchip, some of these swindlers can just smoothly cheat people passing by on the road.
martial arts and Chinese medicine, I can only laugh. I know too little, but I'm aware, I've contacted a few of them, all claimed the same thing, saying "air sunk (returned) to the dantian". Perhaps all those I've encountered are swindlers, in any case I don't know what this means.
