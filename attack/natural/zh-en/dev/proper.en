You should go to Yale University's Doctorate Thesis Archive and look for this report, should be finished now.

】On the afternoon of September 14th, Shanghai officials announced the Deputy Party Secretary Yingyong's official appointment to the post of Deputy Mayor of Shanghai, and also announced the appointment and dismissal of a group of other Shanghai officials.

It's a shame all these countries disappeared long ago, all miscellaneous countries were formatted, only leaving behind the unified Qin Dynasty, Han Dynasty, Ming Dynasty, and Qing Dynasty. Japan alone was isolated overseas, and preserved its country name

Speaking of a doctoral suffering from myasthenia gravis, this type of disease is not difficult to treat or expensive, but because they are staying up late to work on their doctoral thesis (on the major cause of the disease), there isn't any good way to follow doctor's orders, and the result is relapse.

Most men die in their twenties and thirties, because once they reach this age, they are only a shadow of themselves, thereafter, life is just an imitation of their own time spent, day after day more mechanical, more pretentiously repeating their deeds and conducts, their thoughts and considerations, their love and hate from when they were alive. —— 《Jean-Christophe》

Hebei and Shandong are two exotic provinces which lean on the sea, but do not show initiative. Instead both stubbornly hold onto farm life and way of thinking. The Chinese Revolution originated in Guangdong, and the Chinese economy was based in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Shanghai. The newest center of civilization is Beijing, Shanghai, and Guangzhou. They all brushed past Hebei and Shandong. Generally speaking, these two provinces are are the provinces that drag China's development back. Stupid and backwards things below the level of economic development often happen.
